        "#   - Children precede their parents.\n",
        "#   - If a class has multiple parents, the order in which they are listed in the class definition is preserved.\n",
        "#   - If a class has multiple parents that share a common ancestor, the ancestor is visited only once, and the order is determined by the order in which the parents are listed.\n",
